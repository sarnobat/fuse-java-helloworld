Combine the native code compile into the maven project.

At the moment I am manually generating the C API code using the following
command:

java java2c.CAPIGenerator javafs_bindings.h javafs_bindings.c util.h

And then dropping the output files (javafs_bindings.h and javafs_bindings.c)
into the native directory.
